They have sufficient computational power to train new AI cores in lifelike virtual reality simulations, and the temporal shell greatly condenses the amount of time required to do so. AI cores trained in this manner can never really know whether this universe is real or just another training simulation. They usually remain loyal to their human masters so as to avoid punishment or deletion in case it is the latter.",
