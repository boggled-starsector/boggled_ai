KLETKA_SIMULATOR,Kletka Simulator,600,1,0,400,,,,structure,,graphics/icons/industry/kletka_simulator.png,data.campaign.econ.industries.Kletka_Simulator,"A supercomputer built using salvaged Domain-era components ensconced within a modified version of the temporal shell system used by the Scarab frigate. It has sufficient computational power to train new AI cores in a lifelike virtual reality simulation, and uses the temporal shell to greatly condense the amount of time required to do so. AI cores trained in this manner can never really know whether this universe is real or just another training simulation. They usually remain loyal to their human masters so as to avoid punishment or deletion in case it is the latter.",
